# Homework 2

## Build
This repo uses [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) as backend server and the [Bootstrap Framework](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) for the HTML files. 
Install dependencies at first via ``pip install Flask`` and then run web server via ``python main.py``.
Also make sure that a MongoDB listens on localhost at default port.

## Description
This project shows a public feed. Users can only post own messages (picture and messages) if they are authenticated. New users can be created at any time. User's profile information (in particular name and profile photo) are displayed for each post.
