# Homework 2

## Build
This repo uses [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) as backend server and the [Bootstrap Framework](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) for the HTML files. 
Install dependencies at first via ``pip install Flask`` and then run web server via ``python main.py``.
Also make sure that a MongoDB listens on localhost at default port.

## Description
This project stores the profile information of each user and shows it to them after they have authenticated. New users can be created at any time.
